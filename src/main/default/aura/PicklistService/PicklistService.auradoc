		<p>This is a generic and reusable Lightning component that retrives any picklist entries based on an object name and a field name.<br/>
		This is a service component so it has no user interface of it's own: it is meant to be called by other components.</p>

		<p>See the <code>getEntries</code> Aura method for usage.</p>
